But my curiosity does not end there, I do believe that the future is interdisciplinary, so I'm looking to collaborate on any other fields such as biology, biomechanics, medicine, psychology, law, security and so on. You will find different repositories with code for different fields of work.

I am currently learning web development, with a future increasengly connected to the internet, this for me was the obvious step to take. The goal is to be a Full Stack web developer and be able to deploy any future project on the internet.

You can reach me by email or linkedin with the same user <b>@jearizaa</b>.
